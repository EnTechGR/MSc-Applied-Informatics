# AIS Data Analysis and Visualization

This project is a data analysis and visualization system for Automatic Identification System (AIS) data, collected from a live stream. It demonstrates the process of retrieving, storing, and analyzing ship static data to identify and track vessels within a specific geographical area. The project was created as an assignment for a data-related course.

## Project Description

The system consists of two main parts: a data retrieval script and a data analysis notebook.

-   **Data Retrieval (`AIS_Data_Retrieve.py`)**: This Python script connects to an open-source AIS live stream, filters for `ShipStaticData` messages, and appends the relevant information (ship name, MMSI, location, etc.) to a CSV file.
-   **Data Analysis (`data_analysis.ipynb`)**: This Jupyter Notebook processes the raw data from the CSV file to perform various analyses and visualizations. It includes a description of the data, library imports, and the code for plotting and understanding the movement of specific ships.

## Project Structure

* **`AIS_Data_Retrieve.py`**: The script used to connect to the AIS stream and retrieve data.
* **`data.csv`**: The CSV file where the raw AIS data is stored. This file is generated by the `AIS_Data_Retrieve.py` script.
* **`data_analysis.ipynb`**: The Jupyter Notebook containing the data analysis and visualization code.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.x
* A stable internet connection for the live AIS data stream.

### Installation

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone [your-repository-url]
    ```

2.  Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd [your-project-directory]
    ```

### Usage

#### 1. Data Retrieval

First, you need to retrieve the data from the AIS stream.

* **Note**: Before running the script, you must obtain an API key from the AIS stream provider and insert it into the `AIS_Data_Retrieve.py` file.

Run the data retrieval script from your terminal:

```bash
python3 AIS_Data_Retrieve.py
