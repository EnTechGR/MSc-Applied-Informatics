# Security Project Portfolio

This repository contains the final deliverables for the "Security Project," a course project for the Master of Science in Applied Informatics at Charokopio University. The project provides a detailed analysis and comparison of various cryptographic algorithms and digital signature schemes, as well as an examination of a digital certificate.

## Project Files

* **`ap23011_Security_Report.pdf`**: This PDF contains the comprehensive project report. It outlines the methodology, presents the results, and provides detailed documentation of the findings. You can view the full report by clicking **[here](Security_Report.pdf)**.
* **`ap23011_security.ipynb`**: This Jupyter Notebook contains all the Python code used to conduct the experiments for this project. The notebook is fully reproducible and includes code for encrypting, decrypting, signing, and verifying data. You can view the notebook directly on GitHub by clicking **[here](security.ipynb)**.

## Project Overview & Key Findings

### Cryptographic Analysis

The project compares symmetric encryption algorithms and Message Authentication Code (MAC) algorithms. Key findings from this analysis include:

* **Symmetric Encryption**: The **Fernet** algorithm produces a significantly larger encrypted output compared to **ChaCha20Poly1305** and **AES-GCM**. This is because Fernet adds metadata, resulting in slower performance but greater ease of use. The ChaCha20Poly1305 and AES-GCM algorithms are more performant and produce output of the same size as they both use a 16-byte authentication tag.
* **Message Authentication Codes (MAC)**: The **HMAC** algorithm produces a 32-byte tag, while **CMAC** and **Poly1305** both create 16-byte tags. This highlights a key difference in the length and format of the integrity tags generated by these algorithms.

### Digital Signature Analysis

The project also includes a comparative analysis of three prominent digital signature algorithms:

* **DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm)**
* **RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)**
* **Ed25519**

The Jupyter Notebook implements and compares these algorithms, showcasing their practical application in signing and verifying data.

### Digital Certificate Analysis

The report section on digital certificates provides a thorough examination of a sample certificate, detailing its essential attributes, including:

* The certificate **issuer** and **owner**.
* The **signature algorithm** and **key size**.
* The certificate's **serial number**.
* The **issuing and expiration dates**.
* The certificate's **signing date and time**.
